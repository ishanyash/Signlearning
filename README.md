# Signlearning
Machine learning project made by our team at Hacktech 2019, Caltech. Tracks the pose and orientation of the user's hand and compares it against a database of know signs. Integrating more leap-motion cameras and a user friendly interface! Also, building out the gesture/sign language library!

The Package comes with the databases from where the model predicts the pose which is retrieved from the user's hand via leap motion.
